creation of nodes, even used in tress also

class node:
      def __init__(self,val):  #constructor
            self.data= val
            self.next= none
TREE:
1. binary tree
2. binary search tree

⦁	binary tree
1. full binary tree:
every node must have two or zero 0 children

2. complete binary tree:
⦁	every level must be completly filled except the last level.
⦁	the last level node should be left as possible.


3. perfect binary tree:
⦁	all the leaf nodes must be at the same level
⦁	all non leaf nodes must have 2 children

4. balanced binary tree:
height difference b/w left subtree and right subtree at any node must be max 1 and min 0.

5. de- generative binary tree:
every non leaf node must have 1 children
